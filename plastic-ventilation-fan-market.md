<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plastic Ventilation Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The plastic ventilation fan market is primarily categorized into axial and centrifugal types. Axial fans move air parallel to the fan's axis, making them ideal for applications needing high airflow at low pressure, such as in residential ventilation. In contrast, centrifugal fans draw air in at a right angle to the axis, creating higher pressure and suitable for removing air in industrial settings. Both types leverage plastic components for durability, lightweight construction, and resistance to corrosion, enhancing their versatility in various environments.</p></p>
