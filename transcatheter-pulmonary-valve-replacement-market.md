<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon-Expanded</li><li>Self-Expanded</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement market is categorized into two main types: balloon-expanded and self-expanded valves. Balloon-expanded valves are deployed using a balloon that expands the valve into place, providing immediate support and stability. In contrast, self-expanded valves utilize a design that allows them to expand automatically upon deployment, adapting to the vessel shape. Both types offer minimally invasive options for treating pulmonary valve diseases, enhancing patient recovery and outcomes while reducing procedural risks.</p></p>
